      The top of the window shows you a small version of the selected
      background.  Below are boxes which let you select what mode your
      background uses:
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Wallpaper</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Displays your wallpaper in its native form.  You should
	      choose this if your wallpaper is of the exact dimensions
	      of your screen resolution.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Centered</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Places your image directly in the center of your screen.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Scaled</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Stretches your image, but keeps the aspect ratio.  This
	      will keep your image from looking funny because it has
	      been stretched too much in one direction.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Stretched</term>
	  <listitem>

    <para>
      Below the said buttons are options to configure the colors.
      These only matter if you selected <guibutton>No
      Picture</guibutton> or your image doesn't fill the whole
      screen.
    </para>
    <para>
      If your image doesn't take up the entire screen, you have the
      option of how to color the outside of it.  You can either choose
      a vertical gradient, horizontal gradient, or a standard solid
      color.  If you choose a solid color, you select the color at
      right by clicking on <guibutton>Color</guibutton>.  If you pick
      a gradient, you will have two options.  Select the colors you
      wish to do and your options will be made automatically.
